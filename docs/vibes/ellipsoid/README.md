# Ellipsoid Vibe 🌐

This folder contains an interactive **prolate ellipsoid demo**.

The idea: ellipsoids with an aspect ratio of ~1.3–1.7 pack more efficiently
than spheres when poured (“pour-and-forget” packing). This HTML demo
lets you adjust aspect ratio, axis, and rendering mode in the browser.
