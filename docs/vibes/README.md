# Vibes

This folder is a collection of **random ideas** quickly prototyped into code with the help of AI (ChatGPT).

Each subfolder (e.g. `ellipsoid/`, `cube/`) contains a self-contained HTML demo that you can open in your browser or view live via GitHub Pages.

👉 These aren’t polished libraries or production tools — just **explorations and experiments**, brought to code by AI, to capture a “vibe.”
